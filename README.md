## **Introduction:**

This project explores an HR dataset to identify and understand patterns behind employee attrition. By using Microsoft Power BI, the dashboard provides actionable insights into workforce stability, key risk indicators, and areas for HR improvement - The aim is not only to highlight who is leaving but also to explore why they are leaving â€” and what organizations can do to retain their talent.

With rising competition across industries, talent management has become a strategic priority. Through this project, we leverage interactive data visualization to equip HR professionals, decision-makers, and analysts with insights that can drive employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention.

## **Objectives of the project:**

*. Identify key drivers of employee resignation.

*. Analyze demographic and role-based trends affecting attrition.

*. Understand the impact of job satisfaction, compensation, and career development.

*. Recommend HR policies to reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

## Methodology:

### Data Preparation:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

-Removed redundant or empty fields.

-Unified column formats and names.

-Ensured consistency across both sheets.

 **2. Power BI Data Modeling:**

-Established relationships between data columns.

-Created measures and calculated columns (e.g., Attrition Rate %).

-Segmented data for better granularity (e.g., by department or education field).

**3. Visualizations:**

-Attrition Overview: Trend over departments, roles, and age groups.

-Engagement Analysis: How work-life balance, satisfaction, and promotions correlate with resignation.
