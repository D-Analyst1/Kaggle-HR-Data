![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47cc5599-6649-4f20-8ff8-978dfbfab37f)

## **Introduction:**

This project explores an HR dataset to identify and understand patterns behind employee attrition. By using Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Excel, the dashboard provides actionable insights into workforce stability, key risk indicators, and areas for HR improvement - The aim is not only to highlight who is leaving but also to explore why they are leaving ‚Äî and what organizations can do to retain their talent.

With rising competition across industries, talent management has become a strategic priority. Through this project, we leverage interactive data visualization to equip HR professionals, decision-makers, and analysts with insights that can drive employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention.

## **Objectives of the project:**

*. Identify key drivers of employee resignation.

*. Analyze demographic and role-based trends affecting attrition.

*. Understand the impact of job satisfaction, compensation, and career development.

*. Recommend HR policies to reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

## Data Dictionary:

The dataset is structured to capture a broad view of employee profiles, covering demographic, job-related, experiential, and engagement attributes. Below is a categorized breakdown of the key features:

| Category              | Features                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Demographics**      | Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status                                   |
| **Job Information**   | Department, Job Role, Business Travel, Daily Rate                        |
| **Experience Metrics**| Total Working Years, Years at Company, Promotions                        |
| **Engagement Metrics**| Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Training Times                      |
| **Target Variable**   | Staff Resignation (Yes/No)

## Methodology:

### Data Preparation:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

-Removed redundant or empty fields.

-Unified column formats and names.

-Ensured consistency across both sheets.

 **2. Power BI Data Modeling:**

-Established relationships between data columns.

-Created measures and calculated columns (e.g., Attrition Rate %).

-Segmented data for better granularity (e.g., by department or education field).

**3. Visualizations:**

-Attrition Overview: Trend over departments, roles, and age groups.

-Engagement Analysis: How work-life balance, satisfaction, and promotions correlate with resignation.

-Compensation Insights: Relation between pay levels and attrition.

-Predictive Heatmaps: Where resignations are more likely.

## Visualization Insights:

**1. Early Career Risk:**  Employees with less than 3 years at the company show higher resignation rates.

**2. Low Work-Life Balance:** Correlates strongly with attrition across all departments.

**3. Department Variability:** Sales and R&D show different patterns of turnover, needing tailored interventions.

**4. Stock Options Impact:** Employees with stock options tend to stay longer, suggesting a retention incentive.

## **Recommendations:**

1. **Strengthen Onboarding for New Hires**  
   Employees with less than 2 years at the company are more likely to resign. Enhance early-stage engagement through structured onboarding, mentorship, and regular check-ins.

2. **Improve Work-Life Balance Policies**  
   High attrition correlates with lower work-life balance scores. Implement flexible working hours, hybrid options, and encourage managers to respect personal boundaries.

3. **Review Internal Mobility & Promotion Paths**  
   Lack of promotion opportunities contributes to career stagnation. Create transparent promotion guidelines and internal recruitment pipelines to boost motivation.

4. **Tailor Retention Strategies by Department**  
   Departments like Sales or R&D may have unique attrition drivers. Use targeted interventions‚Äîsuch as sales incentives or research grants‚Äîbased on department-level insights.

5. **Use Predictive Metrics to Flag At-Risk Employees**  
   Combine data on satisfaction, overtime, and training gaps to create an internal ‚Äúattrition risk score.‚Äù This allows HR to proactively engage with potentially disengaged staff.

6. **Enhance Learning and Development (L&D)**  
   Employees receiving fewer training hours often show higher resignation rates. Boost L&D opportunities and align them with career goals.

7. **Link Stock Options or Performance Bonuses to Retention**  
   Those with stock options tend to stay longer. Expand incentive programs that promote long-term thinking and loyalty.
